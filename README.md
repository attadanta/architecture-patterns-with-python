# Readme

This repository follows along the book [Architecture Patterns with Python -
Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven
Microservices][1] by Harry Percival and Bob Gregory.

The repository is organized in separate directories for each chapter. Each one
defines its own venv. I don't know wheter this is the best choice, but I am new
to python and it gives me the feeling of starting anew with each step of the
way. I might revert this decision later and start leveraging source control
instead.
